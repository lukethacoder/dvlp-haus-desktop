## Install

Clone the repository

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

## Usage

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Packaging

We use [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) to build and package the application. By default you can run the following to package for your current platform:

```bash
yarn package
```

This will create an unzipped version of your application in the `out` folder.

```bash
yarn make
```

This will create a distributable version of your app.
